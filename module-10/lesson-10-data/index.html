    <h2>Web Cartography at the University of Kentucky</h2>

    <p>The materials that you are looking at illustrate my cartography and geo-spatial work both as they currently exist and as I transition to working with more web-based geo-spatial analysis and cartography.</p>

    <h3>PROJECT 1--Map of Crime and Quality of Life in the 2800 block of East Washington Avenue Incidents</h3>
   
    <section class="project">
        <a href="Full-size-Images_Maps/Map1.jpg"><img src="Images_Maps/Map1.jpg" alt="Map of Crime" class="project-image"/></a>
       
       
        <p>This map illustrates the work that I have performed as a crime analyst with the City of Madison Police Department. It uses quality of life and crime data generated by the police CAD system so that it captures all calls that were geneated by citizens. This map helps decision-makers assess call volume and the crime dynamics occuring at this location.</p>
        <p>This map was created using ArcGIS and LERMS/police data</p>
        <ul>
            <li>See the map: <a href="Full-size-Images_Maps/Map1.jpg">Map of Crime</a></li>

    <h3>PROJECT 2--Map of Crime and Quality of Life Incidents in the Darbo Neighborhood</h3>
    <section class="project">
        <a href="Full-size-Images_Maps/Map2.jpg"><img src="Images_Maps/Map2.jpg" alt="Map of Crime" class="project-image" /></a>
    
        <h3></h3>
        <p>Similar to the previous map in Project 1, this map displays data from different periods of time (i.e. months) in a micro-place that has experienced elevated call volume and serious crime and quality of life incidents in a relatively small area known as a micro-place.</p>
        <p>This map was created using ArcGIS and LERMS/police data</p>

    <h3>PROJECT 3--Balancing Habitat Preservation with Transportation Needs in Centre County Pennsylvania (GEO 472)</h3>
    <section class="project">
        <a href="Full-size-Images_Maps/Map4.jpg"><img src="Images_Maps/Map4.jpg" alt="Map of Crime" class="project-image" /></a>
    
        <h3></h3>
        <p>The goal of this map is to visualize on a map product those areas in Centre County, Pennsylvania that meet specified criteria. More specifically, the analysis will be used by the Centre County Planning Office to explore a proposed biological reserve system within Centre County. Areas that meet specific criteria would be protected based on a variety of factors including the number of different plant and mammal species and habitat quality. The map produced from this geospatial analysis will assist the decision making process of government officials in evaluating the proposed biological reserve system.  This map illustrates multiple variables related to land use and habitat population as they relate to transportation planning</p>
        Summary of project goals:
        
        <li>Greater than 70 bird and mammalian species combined<a</li>
        <li>Less than 10% of each study area occupied by buffered roads, highways, and interstates<a</li>
        <li>High habitat potential<a</li>
        <li>Publicly-owned land<a</li>
        <li>Forested areas<a</li>
        <li>Slope less than 10%<a</li>      
             
        <p>The map was created using ArcGIS as well as U.S. Census and Pennsylvania state and county level data.</p>
