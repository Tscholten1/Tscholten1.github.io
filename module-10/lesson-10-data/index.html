    <p>The materials that you are looking at illustrate my cartography and geo-spatial work both as they currently exist and as I transition to working with more web-based geo-spatial analysis and cartogrphy.</p>
    
    <h3>PROJECT 1--Map of Crime and Quality of Life Incidents</h3>
    <section>
        <a href="Full-size-Images_Maps/Map1.jpg"><img src="Images_Maps/Map1.jpg" alt="Map of Crime" /></a>
       
        <h3></h3>
        <p>This map illustrates the work that I have performed as a crime analyst with the City of Madison Police Department. It uses quality of life and crime data generated by the police CAD system so that it captures all calls that were geneated by citizens. This map helps decision-makers assess call volume and the crime dynamics occuring at this location.</p>
        <p>This map was created using ArcGIS and LERMS/police data</p>

        <p>Similar to the previous map in Project 1, this map displays data from different periods of time (i.e. months) in a micro-place that has experienced elevated call volume and serious crime and quality of life incidents in a relatively small area known as a micro-place.</p>
        <p>This map was created using ArcGIS and LERMS/police data</p>

        <p>This map illustrates multiple variables related to land use and habitat population as they relate to transportation planning</p>
        <p>The map was created using ArcGIS as well as U.S. Census and Pennsylvania state and county level data.</p>
